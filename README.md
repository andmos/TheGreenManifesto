# The Green Manifesto

## Intro

The Green Manifesto is a personal manifest I try to live by for doing my part in fighting climate change. The goal is to spread awareness on what (most) individuals can do on their own without too much hassle and sacrifice, as well as fight the ["Tragedy of the commons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) argumentation that often meets individual people who wants to live greener. Of course many people don't have the privilege of living close to work or the option to by more expensive, but sustainable clothing, electric vehicle etc. This manifesto is  achievable for the typical middle-class person or family, and this is also where most of the impact can be made.

## Transportation

* Use a bike. For day-to-day transportation, like traveling to work (if in biking distance), to the store etc. Favor the bicycle. It's simple, cheap, easy to repair and good for personal health as well as the environment. To avoid owning and repairing a bike, use bikesharing systems. The North American BikeShare Association(NABSA) maintains a [list of systems](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) implementing their open standard.

* Avoid driving personal cars as much as possible, and favor public transportation. Cutting down personal car usage has a positive impact on both the local and the global environment, air-quality etc. In most cities favoring public transportation, the time saved commuting can also be a game changer. If a personal car has to be used, try carpooling and avoid single-person driving.

* Reduce flying (if possible) when traveling domestic/international and favor the train. In most countries with a decent railroad system, the train can be used to travel longer distances with higher speed and comfort. Most modern trains have decent internet connections, making it possible for some work groups to work remote when traveling in office hours. Most trains also provide sleeping cars for traveling at night.

* If possible, live within short traveling distance to the workplace / other often visited locations and favor walking, biking or public transportation.

## Food and nutrition

* Store leftovers in plastic - but use more permanent plastic, like containers. Glass containers are also good. Avoid disposable plastic. Most [Tupperware containers have a lifetime warranty](https://www.tupperwareindia.com/help/lifetime-warranty), so it's built to last. For wrapping, [beeswax wrap](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320419125_The_anti-microbial_effect_of_food_wrap_containing_beeswax_products) is a good alternative for replacing plastic as well as contribute to preventing food spoilage.

## Consumption

* When buying cheap products and consumer goods, do the same exercise as most people do when they invest in more expensive products: Do the research. Try to find out as much as possible about the product, how and where it is produced etc. Many cheap products comes from cheap production lines and factories that cuts costs, thus [harming the environment in the process.](https://phys.org/news/2016-02-affects-environment.html).
