# The Green Manifesto

## Intro

The Green Manifesto is a personal manifest I try to live by for doing my part in fighting climate change. The goal is to spread awareness on what (most) individuals can do on their own without too much hassle and sacrifice, as well as fight the ["Tragedy of the commons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) argumentation that often meets individual people who wants to live greener. Of course many people don't have the privilege of living close to work or the option to by more expensive, but sustainable clothing, electric vehicle etc. This manifesto is  achievable for the typical middle-class person or family, and this is also where most of the impact can be made.

## Transportation

* Use a bike. For day-to-day transportation, like traveling to work (if in biking distance), to the store etc. Favor the bicycle. It's simple, cheap, easy to repair and good for personal health as well as the environment. To avoid owning and repairing a bike, use bikesharing systems. The North American BikeShare Association(NABSA) maintains a [list of systems](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) implementing their open standard.

* Avoid driving personal cars as much as possible, and favor public transportation. Cutting down personal car usage has a positive impact on both the local and the global environment, air-quality etc. In most cities favoring public transportation, the time saved commuting can also be a game changer. If a personal car has to be used, try carpooling and avoid single-person driving. When using taxi or ride-sharing services, [sharing it with others can improve traffic, save money etc.](http://news.mit.edu/2016/how-ride-sharing-can-improve-traffic-save-money-and-help-environment-0104)

* If it isn't possible to live without a personal car, choose electric if possible, and preferably a pre-owned one. The environmental costs of producing new electric vehicles are [higher for electric cars that traditional fossil ful cars](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/life-cycle-ev-emissions#.XFHbjs9Kjfb), but after 18 months of driving this manufactory cost has been repaid. If buying pre-owned, the manufactory cost is saved. Do research and be mindful about how the electricity the electric car uses is produced.

* Reduce flying (if possible) when traveling domestic/international and favor the train. In most countries with a decent railroad system, the train can be used to travel longer distances with higher speed and comfort. Most modern trains have decent internet connections, making it possible for some work groups to work remote when traveling in office hours. Most trains also provide sleeping cars for traveling at night.

* If possible, live within short traveling distance to the workplace / other often visited locations and favor walking, biking or public transportation.

## Food and nutrition

* Store leftovers in plastic - but use more permanent plastic, like containers. Glass containers are also good. Avoid disposable plastic. Most [Tupperware containers have a lifetime warranty](https://www.tupperwareindia.com/help/lifetime-warranty), so it's built to last. For wrapping, [beeswax wrap](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320419125_The_anti-microbial_effect_of_food_wrap_containing_beeswax_products) is a good alternative for replacing plastic as well as contribute to preventing food spoilage.

* Reduce meat consumption and strive towards a flexitarian diet if possible. To be able to limit climate change, water scarcity and pollution, as well as have a sustainable food production to feed a growing global population, [studies say that the global meat consumption must down.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0594-0.epdf?referrer_access_token=aHzjao37AXq8oXPutRs8dtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M2ZckU8PFAjFp2beHrcOXhMGtzE8nzrDqubMx9ONW9UA5zVO6AEIZau) The difference in fossil fuel usage between animal protein versus plant protein is dramatic [a study done in 2003 from the American Society for Clinical Nutrition finds](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/78/3/660S/4690010):

    > The average fossil energy input for all the animal protein production systems studied is 25 kcal fossil energy input per 1 kcal of protein produced. This energy input is more than 11 times greater than that for grain protein production, which is about 2.2 kcal of fossil energy input per 1 kcal of plant protein produced. This is for corn and assumes 9% protein in the corn. Animal protein is a complete protein based on its amino acid profile and has about 1.4 times the biological value of grain protein.

    The same study cites that "Producing 1 kg of animal protein requires about 100 times more water than producing 1 kg of grain protein", and livestock uses 1.3% of all water in agriculture. When plant based protein is used as food source for livestock, the aggregated number grows dramatically.
    A pure vegetarian (or vegan) diet helps sustainability, but a [a vegan diet alone lacks nutrients that requires supplements](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318135128_The_impact_of_vegan_diet_on_health_and_growth_of_children_and_adolescents_-_Literature_review). A flexitarian approach with _less meat consumption_ is accessible for a wider group and is also [healthy.](https://nutritionstudies.org/research-confirms-a-plant-based-diet-can-help-you-live-longer/)  

* Avoid products originating from organic farming. The idea of organic farming as "greener" and good for the environment as a whole is a [myth](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/organic-farming-is-bad-for-the-environment/). The average organic diet requires [40% more land than the average diet, even though the carbon footprint is essentialy equal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617309666). The average diet contains about 45% meat, which is the main driver for carbon emission. Take away most of the meat, and the footprint of the flexitarian non-organic diet comes out on top.

* Avoid products containing palm oil. [The cultivation of oil producing palms are a mayor driver in deforestation where local forests and growth are cut down to support palms, which leads to killing biodiversity](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/pdf/palm_oil_study_kh0218208enn_new.pdf). The carbon footprint this process produces is not sustainable.

## Consumption

* When buying cheap products and consumer goods, do the same exercise as most people do when they invest in more expensive products: Do the research. Try to find out as much as possible about the product, how and where the production happens etc. It's not unusual for cheap products to come from cheap production lines and factories that cuts costs, thus [harming the environment in the process.](https://phys.org/news/2016-02-affects-environment.html)

* Buy repairable electronics, and repair if they break. Electronics, especially smartphones, are quite expensive, so there is a personal economic upside to repair over throwing away and buying new. Repairing over buying is also beneficial for the environment. It is measured that we generate [41 million tonnes of e-waste each year](http://i.unu.edu/media/ias.unu.edu-en/news/7916/Global-E-waste-Monitor-2014-small.pdf). Thatâ€™s the equivalent of throwing out 800 laptops every single second. The grade in which the e-waste is recycled, minerals re-used, toxic materials properly disposed etc. varies extremely from where in the world the waste is taken care of. The health risk of toxic materials not properly handled is [dramatic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195925509001486). The last years has seen a [rise in local businesses offering repairs of smartphones](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=10&ved=2ahUKEwj3tb_kpYLhAhUDyaYKHZ8PBcIQFjAJegQIBxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F1996-1073%2F12%2F3%2F498%2Fpdf&usg=AOvVaw1d8HfjXO_3_RediOJaVgAu), so repairing over buying helps with local economical growth. If the device is beyond repair, make sure it is returned and taken care of. [Apple for instance offers a return program](https://www.apple.com/recycling/nationalservices/) that guarantees proper recycling of old electronic products.
