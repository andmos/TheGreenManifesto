# The Green Manifesto

## Intro

The Green Manifesto is a personal manifest I try to live by for doing my part in fighting climate change. The goal is to spread awareness on what (most) individuals can do on their own without too much hassle and sacrifice, as well as fight the ["Tragedy of the commons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) argumentation that often meets individual people who wants to live greener, that it doesn't matter what one individual does. Of course many people don't have the privilege of living close to work or the option to by more expensive, but sustainable clothing, electric vehicle etc. This manifesto is  achievable for the typical middle-class person or family, and this is also where most of the impact can be made.

## Transportation

* Use a bike. For day-to-day transportation, like traveling to work (if in biking distance), to the store etc. Favor the bicycle. It's simple, cheap, easy to repair and good for personal health as well as the environment. To avoid owning and repairing a bike, use bikesharing systems. The North American BikeShare Association(NABSA) maintains a [list of systems](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) implementing their open standard.

* Avoid driving personal cars as much as possible, and favor public transportation. Cutting down personal car usage has a positive impact on both the local and the global environment, air-quality etc. In most cities favoring public transportation, the time saved commuting can also be a game changer. If a personal car is unavoidable, try carpooling and avoid single-person driving. When using taxi or ride-sharing services, [sharing it with others can improve traffic, save money etc.](http://news.mit.edu/2016/how-ride-sharing-can-improve-traffic-save-money-and-help-environment-0104)

* If it isn't possible to live without a personal car, choose electric if possible, and preferably a pre-owned one. The environmental costs of producing new electric vehicles are [higher for electric cars that traditional fossil ful cars](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/life-cycle-ev-emissions#.XFHbjs9Kjfb), but after 18 months of driving this manufactory cost has been repaid. If buying pre-owned, the manufactory cost is saved. Do research and be mindful about how the electricity the electric car uses is produced.

* Reduce flying (if possible) when traveling domestic/international and favor the train. In most countries with a decent railroad system, the train is good for travel longer distances with higher speed and comfort. Most modern trains have decent internet connections, making it possible for some work groups to work remote when traveling in office hours. Most trains also provide sleeping cars for traveling at night.

* If possible, live within short traveling distance to the workplace / other often visited locations and favor walking, biking or public transportation. Modern society is city-based, and [the United Nations projects that 68 percent of world population will live in urban areas by 2050](https://phys.org/news/2018-05-percent-world-population-urban-areas.html). Studies also finds that [the average city-living person has a lower carbon footprint than the ones living in the country](https://www.livescience.com/13772-city-slicker-country-bumpkin-smaller-carbon-footprint.html). To keep the footprint low as cities grow bigger, "local living" will be important to keep the footprint down, [as well as our physical and mental health](http://time.com/9912/10-things-your-commute-does-to-your-body/).

## Food and nutrition

* Store leftovers in plastic - but use more permanent plastic, like containers. Glass containers are also good. Avoid disposable plastic. Most [Tupperware containers have a lifetime warranty](https://www.tupperwareindia.com/help/lifetime-warranty), so it's built to last. For wrapping, [beeswax wrap](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320419125_The_anti-microbial_effect_of_food_wrap_containing_beeswax_products) is a good alternative for replacing plastic as well as contribute to preventing food spoilage.

* Reduce meat consumption and strive towards a flexitarian diet if possible. To be able to limit climate change, water scarcity and pollution, as well as have a sustainable food production to feed a growing global population, [studies say that the global meat consumption must down.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0594-0.epdf?referrer_access_token=aHzjao37AXq8oXPutRs8dtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M2ZckU8PFAjFp2beHrcOXhMGtzE8nzrDqubMx9ONW9UA5zVO6AEIZau) The difference in fossil fuel usage between animal protein versus plant protein is dramatic [a study done in 2003 from the American Society for Clinical Nutrition finds](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/78/3/660S/4690010):

    > The average fossil energy input for all the animal protein production systems studied is 25 kcal fossil energy input per 1 kcal of protein produced. This energy input is more than 11 times greater than that for grain protein production, which is about 2.2 kcal of fossil energy input per 1 kcal of plant protein produced. This is for corn and assumes 9% protein in the corn. Animal protein is a complete protein based on its amino acid profile and has about 1.4 times the biological value of grain protein.

    The same study cites that "Producing 1 kg of animal protein requires about 100 times more water than producing 1 kg of grain protein", and livestock uses 1.3% of all water in agriculture. When plant based protein is used as food source for livestock, the aggregated number grows dramatically.
    A pure vegetarian (or vegan) diet helps sustainability, but a [a vegan diet alone lacks nutrients that requires supplements](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318135128_The_impact_of_vegan_diet_on_health_and_growth_of_children_and_adolescents_-_Literature_review). A flexitarian approach with _less meat consumption_ is accessible for a wider group and is also [healthy.](https://nutritionstudies.org/research-confirms-a-plant-based-diet-can-help-you-live-longer/)  

* Avoid products originating from organic farming. The idea of organic farming as "greener" and good for the environment as a whole is a [myth](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/organic-farming-is-bad-for-the-environment/). The average organic diet requires [40% more land than the average diet, even though the carbon footprint is essentialy equal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617309666). The average diet contains about 45% meat, which is the main driver for carbon emission. Take away most of the meat, and the footprint of the flexitarian non-organic diet comes out on top.

* Avoid products containing palm oil. [The cultivation of oil producing palms are a mayor driver in deforestation where local forests and growth are cut down to support palms, which leads to killing biodiversity](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/pdf/palm_oil_study_kh0218208enn_new.pdf). The carbon footprint this process produces is not sustainable.

* If possible, set up a compost bin for biodegradable waste. Composting is a process that works to speed up the natural decay of organic material by providing the ideal conditions for detritus-eating organisms to thrive, according to the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/newsroom/features/?cid=nrcs143_023537). The end-product of this concentrated decomposition process is nutrient-rich soil that can help crops, garden plants and trees to grow. Composting is also an [effective way to reduce greenhouse gases like methane](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1065657X.1996.10701842), and this created soil and dirt helps with binding carbon dioxide.

* Be mindful about the impacts everyday groceries and favorite food has on the environment. One of the mayor problems driving climate change is overconsumption. As an example, Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world after oil. This high demand has led to deforestation. In Central America alone, [2.5 million acres of forest is cleared](https://www.sustainablebusinesstoolkit.com/environmental-impact-coffee-trade/) to be able to grow coffee. These tropical forests are critical for protecting atmospheric dynamics, water quality, wildlife etc. Processing coffee also generates much waste, which if not handled properly, is able to pollute local water supplies. Other cheap foods like some species of tuna are [classified as threatened because of overfishing](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/fish/tunas-and-marlins-officially-classified-threatened), while popular fruits like avocado gets transported in high numbers around the world and has a water usage of [227 liters per fruit](https://waterfootprint.org/en/about-us/news/news/grace-launches-new-water-footprint-calculator/).

* Reduce consumption of, or switch from dairy milk to non-dairy milk. [Producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times the greenhouse gas emissions of any non-dairy milks](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b0b53649-5e93-4415-bf07-6b0b1227172f/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=Reducing_foods_environment_impacts_Science%2B360%2B6392%2B987%2B-%2BAccepted%2BManuscript.pdf&type_of_work=Journal+article). Of the non-dairy alternatives, Almond milk uses the most water, while rice milk has the largest emission footprint [because of methane produced by bacteria](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/guidelin/ch4ref5.pdf). Soy and oat based milks are the best non-dairy alternatives with this in mind.

## Consumption

* When buying cheap products and consumer goods, do the same exercise as most people do when they invest in more expensive products: Do the research. Try to find out as much as possible about the product, how and where the production happens etc. It's not unusual for cheap products to come from cheap production lines and factories that cuts costs, thus [harming the environment in the process.](https://phys.org/news/2016-02-affects-environment.html)

* Buy repairable electronics, and repair if they break. Electronics, especially smartphones, are quite expensive, so there is a personal economic upside to repair over throwing away and buying new. Repairing over buying is also beneficial for the environment. It is measured that we generate [41 million tonnes of e-waste each year](http://i.unu.edu/media/ias.unu.edu-en/news/7916/Global-E-waste-Monitor-2014-small.pdf). That’s the equivalent of throwing out 800 laptops every single second. The grade in which the e-waste is recycled, minerals re-used, toxic materials properly disposed etc. varies from where in the world the waste is taken care of. The health risk of toxic materials not properly handled is [dramatic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195925509001486). The last years has seen a [rise in local businesses offering repairs of smartphones](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=10&ved=2ahUKEwj3tb_kpYLhAhUDyaYKHZ8PBcIQFjAJegQIBxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F1996-1073%2F12%2F3%2F498%2Fpdf&usg=AOvVaw1d8HfjXO_3_RediOJaVgAu), so repairing over buying helps with local economical growth. If the device is beyond repair, make sure it is returned and taken care of. [Apple for instance offers a return program](https://www.apple.com/recycling/nationalservices/) that guarantees proper recycling of old electronic products.

* Consider starting (or participate to) a [lending library club](https://lendinglibrary.club/). In short, a lending library club is organized around people (like a neighborhood, your workplace etc.) keeping inventory of things that can be lent out for a optional length of time. Examples are tools, party equipment or other things that is used infrequently. Borrowing these items over buying them prevents over-consumption, and can help strengthen local communities in a social way.

* When buying takeaway coffee, bring a reusable cup. Most cafés and coffee shops provide takeaway coffee in paper cups. Even though these paper cups can seem environment neutral, most kinds are [made up by a small plastic lining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFXznoNqRfo) to make them hold the liquid. In most cases the plastic in the cup makes them [unrecyclable](https://paper.org.uk/PDF/Public/Publications/Position%20Papers/CoffeeCupsSept17.pdf). With the current consumption, it is estimated that UK alone generates a waste amount of  [10 000 cups every two minutes](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36882799). To avoid adding to the waste pile, consider bringing a reusable cup to order a beverage for. Many coffee shops now [give a discount](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/coffee-shops-will-offer-50pc-discount-reusing-cup/) for bringing a reusable cup too. Be mindful that [it would take between 20 and 100 uses for a reusable cup to make up for the greenhouse gas emissions of a single-use cup](http://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2017/07/reusable-or-disposable-which-coffee-cup-has-a-smaller-footprint/), so consider not taking the coffee on the go at all, enjoying the coffee in a regular ceramic cup in the café itself is a good choice.

## Investment and Philanthropy

* When investing money in the marked, choose the environment-friendly sectors and companies. For people with the means to invest savings, favor eco-investing and choose funds that [exclusively consists of shares in green sectors](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/green-equity-indexes). This includes investing in renewable energy companies while boycotting shares in companies dealing with fossil fuels, etc. The world's biggest fund manager, BlackRock, lost [90 billion dollar investing in fossil fuel companies over 10 years](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/blackrock-lost-90bn-investing-in-fossil-fuel-companies-report-finds), and is now [pulling out of thermal coal](https://reneweconomy.com.au/blackrock-worlds-largest-investment-manager-pulls-out-of-thermal-coal-62121/). CEO and Chairman Larry Fink [urges the importance of green and sustainable investments](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/larry-fink-ceo-letter). Also Microsoft is investing green, (putting 1 billion dollar to a carbon reduction fund)[https://www.greenbiz.com/article/microsofts-quest-go-carbon-negative-inspires-1b-fund]. For startups, there are [many new green-tech companies to keep an eye on](https://www.eu-startups.com/2019/03/10-european-cleantech-startups-innovating-for-a-more-sustainable-future/) for investments.

* When donating to charity, favor the ones that directly challenges climate change. Be mindful and do a thorough background check on the candidates in question and fact-check the [impact the donation will have](https://www.givewell.org/).
